# MailCleaner

MailCleaner is a specialized email utility to zero in on and 
selectively delete old, unwanted, and/or confidential emails. 

Selectively deleting emails is important to protect your privacy, limit the 
advertising profile email providers build on you, limit your potential 
exposure to hackers, or to purge old emails containing personal or 
sensitive information. MailCleaner also helps you stay organized and 
purge unneeded emails or keep your account storage under quota.

For example, MailCleaner can help you periodically delete emails
with bank statements, online purchase receipts, or 
confidential communications. After filtering and reviewing
your email with MailCleaner, you'll likely be surprised
how many emails you'll want to delete.

MailCleaner currently supports email accounts with IMAP support, such as 
Gmail, Google Apps for businesses, or iCloud.

## Features

* **Interactively Filtering**: If you see one message matching a
  sender, domain (organization) or recipient, easily filter to
  selectively delete similar messages.
* **Saved Message Filters**: You can save filters for the types of messages you 
  expect to periodically delete. MailCleaner tracks how many messages
  match each filter, so you'll always know which messages need attention.
* **Multiple Email Account Support**: Use MailCleaner for both personal
  and business email accounts.
* **Message Deletion Options**: Depending on the account type, move messages
  to a special "trash folder" for delayed deletion, or permanently delete 
  them immediately.

## Reasons/Motivations to use MailCleaner

  * For the types of information you used to shred, more 
    and more of this information is communicated via email: e.g.:
      * Bank statements
      * Purchase receipts (iTunes, Amazon)
  * Stay organized and remove old unwanted messages: e.g.:
    * Online purchase receipts
    * Financial statements
    * Old email newsletters, travel itineraries, account notifications
      (e.g., Facebook friends requests).
  * Protect your privacy
    * Personal or confidential email conversations
    * Bill payment notifications
    * Sign-up and other emails from other online accounts 
      (e.g., LinkedIn, 
    * Even though your email account is password protected,
      it is not 100% secure. If the account were to be 
      compromised, the contents of all your messages could
      be exposed.
    * In exchange for free email service, some email providers scan your 
      email to build an advertising profile on you. Left unchecked,
      more and more email will be available for scanning.
  * If you're running out of space or over quota.
  * Keep the size of your inbox minimized, potentially improving
    the performance for reading and writing emails.
  * Purge old emails which are no longer "protected 
    communications" (e.g. after 180 days)
