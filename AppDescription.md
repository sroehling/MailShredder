# MailCleaner

Use MailCleaner to help protect your privacy 
and the privacy of those who send you email.

MailCleaner is a specialized email utility to zero in on and 
selectively delete old, unwanted, or confidential emails. 
While regular email apps focus on reading and writing emails,
MailCleaner is designed to help you efficiently filter, select, 
then bulk delete unwanted messages.

For example, MailCleaner is useful for 
periodically deleting emails
with bank statements, online purchase receipts, or 
confidential messages from friends and family.

Individual messages may be insignificant, but collectively
they represent an extensive profile of what you purchased,
who you've done business with, where you've traveled, and
other confidential business and personal communications. 

After some time, there's really no reason to keep most
messages. However, there are important reasons to delete them, such
as limiting your exposure if your account is compromised, or to 
limit the advertising profile some email providers 
build on you.  

Above and beyond important privacy concerns, MailCleaner also 
helps you stay organized and keep your account storage under quota.
After using MailCleaner, you'll likely be surprised
how many unneeded messages can be safely deleted.

MailCleaner currently supports email accounts with IMAP support, 
such as Gmail, Google Apps for businesses, or iCloud.

## Features

* **Interactively Filtering**: If you see one message matching a
  sender, domain (organization) or recipient, easily filter to
  selectively delete similar messages.
* **Saved Message Filters**: You can save filters for the types of messages you 
  expect to periodically delete. MailCleaner tracks how many messages
  match each filter, so you'll always know which messages need attention.
* **Multiple Email Account Support**: Use MailCleaner for both personal
  and business email accounts.
* **Message Deletion Options**: Depending on the account type, move messages
  to a special "trash folder" for delayed deletion, or permanently delete 
  them immediately.

## Reasons/Motivations to use MailCleaner

  * For the types of information you used to shred, more 
    and more of this information is communicated via email: e.g.:
      * Bank statements
      * Purchase receipts (iTunes, Amazon)
  * Stay organized and remove old unwanted messages: e.g.:
    * Online purchase receipts
    * Financial statements
    * Old email newsletters, travel itineraries, account notifications
      (e.g., Facebook friends requests).
  * Protect your privacy
    * Personal or confidential email conversations
    * Bill payment notifications
    * Sign-up and other emails from other online accounts 
      (e.g., LinkedIn, 
    * Even though your email account is password protected,
      it is not 100% secure. If the account were to be 
      compromised, the contents of all your messages could
      be exposed.
    * In exchange for free email service, some email providers scan your 
      email to build an advertising profile on you. Left unchecked,
      more and more email will be available for scanning.
  * Protect others' privacy - delete sensitive conversations others might send.
  * If you're running out of space or over quota.
  * Keep the size of your inbox minimized, potentially improving
    the performance for reading and writing emails.
  * Purge old emails which are no longer "protected 
    communications" (e.g. after 180 days)
  * Why delete just 1 message? If one message is seen which can potentially be
    deleted, select all of them like to also delete.
    
## Examples

* "noreply" type bulk mail
* Old Email newsletters - e.g. from church, stock trading.
