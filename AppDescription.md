# Email Purger


## Features

* **Interactively Filtering**: If you see one message matching a
  sender, domain (organization) or recipient, easily filter to
  selectively delete similar messages.
* **Saved Message Filters**: You can save filters for the types of messages you 
  expect to periodically delete. MailCleaner tracks how many messages
  match each filter, so you'll always know which messages need attention.
* **Multiple Email Account Support**: Use Email Purger for both personal
  and business email accounts.
* **Message Deletion Options**: Depending on the account type, move messages
  to a special "trash folder" for delayed deletion, or permanently delete 
  them immediately.

## Reasons/Motivations to use Email Purger

  * For the types of information you used to shred, more 
    and more of this information is communicated via email: e.g.:
      * Bank statements
      * Purchase receipts (iTunes, Amazon)
  * Stay organized and remove old unwanted messages: e.g.:
    * Online purchase receipts
    * Financial statements
    * Old email newsletters, travel itineraries, account notifications
      (e.g., Facebook friends requests).
  * Protect your privacy
    * Personal or confidential email conversations
    * Bill payment notifications
    * Sign-up and other emails from other online accounts 
      (e.g., LinkedIn, 
    * Even though your email account is password protected,
      it is not 100% secure. If the account were to be 
      compromised, the contents of all your messages could
      be exposed.
    * In exchange for free email service, some email providers scan your 
      email to build an advertising profile on you. Left unchecked,
      more and more email will be available for scanning.
  * Protect others' privacy - delete sensitive conversations others might send.
  * If you're running out of space or over quota.
  * Keep the size of your inbox minimized, potentially improving
    the performance for reading and writing emails.
  * Purge old emails which are no longer "protected 
    communications" (e.g. after 180 days)
  * Why delete just 1 message? If one message is seen which can potentially be
    deleted, select all of them like to also delete.
    
## Examples

* "noreply" type bulk mail
* Old Email newsletters - e.g. from church, stock trading.
