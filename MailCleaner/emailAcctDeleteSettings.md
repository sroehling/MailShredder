# Email Account Deletion Settings

The deletion settings for an email account determine what happens
when the a message is deleted locally within the MailCleaner app. 

The appropriate values to use for these settings depends on both 
the delete behavior for the email account's provider, such as 
Gmail or iCloud. These settings can also be configured based
upon personal preferences for message deletion.

As described below, these settings work in conjunction with one 
another to provide different message deletion behaviors.
