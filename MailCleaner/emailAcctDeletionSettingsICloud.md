### iCloud Email Deletion Settings

Owners of Apple devices or computers who have an Apple ID also have the 
option to create an iCloud account with an [associated "@me" email address][AppleAtMe]. 
As shown in the table below, the default and recommended message deletion 
settings are tailored to review and delete messages from appropriate 
email folders and to move these messages to the "Deleted Messages" 
to be permanently deleted later.

Email Purger Message Deletion Setting  | Recommended Value | Comments
------------- | ------------- | ----------
Synchronized Folders    | INBOX, Archive, Sent Messages    | Other folders are for drafts and junk mail. Messages within these other folders typically wouldn't be reviewed for deletion.
Trash Folder    | Deleted Messages    | Moving a message to this folder will cause it to be automatically erased (permanently deleted) after 30 days. The [web interface][iCloudWeb] also provides an "Empty Trash" capability to immediately erase messages in the trash folder.
Immediately Erase Messages?    | OFF    | Assuming a 30 day delay to permanently erase the message is acceptable, the recommendation is to not immediately erase messages.
