# MailShredder Settings

## Email Accounts

When MailShredder first opens, it prompts to setup at least one email account. However, MailShredder can also work with multiple email accounts; for example, you could configure MailShredder to work with both your personal and business accounts.

If you have more than one email account setup, the way the MailShredder app works is to show the email messages for whichever account is selected. In other words, if multiple email accounts are configured, email is shown and can be deleted from one account at time. 

To select which account is shown, tap on the settings button at the top right-hand portion of the main screen (with the list of messages), then select the 'Email Accounts' item from the settings screen. You'll see a check mark next to the email account which is currently selected. If you want to change the account for which messages are shown, tap on a different account. When you return to the main screen, you should now see (and be able to deleted) the messages for the newly selected account.

## Messages Shown

The messages shown setting configures the default maximum number of messages which will be shown in the message list. By default, the app will show 100 messages at a time for review and deletion. Depending upon how you use MailShredder, the messages shown setting can be used to increase or decrease this number. For example, if you prefer to review each messages for deletion, you may want to lower this number. However, if you tend to bulk delete large numbers of messages at once (for example, all messages older than 6 months), you could increase this number.

There is also 'Load More Messages' button at the bottom of the message list which will show (and enable deletion of) more messages at once.

The rationale for showing set number of messages at a time is to ensure the app will have sufficient performance (for display of messages) and also have a reasonable level of confirmation before bulk deleting.

## Passcode

When MailShredder is first opened, the app prompts for a passcode. This passcode provides some basic security to MailShredder, so that people who do not know the passcode will not inadvertently delete messages. Depending upon your preference for this type of security, this passcode can be turned on and off.
