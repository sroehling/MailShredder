### Google Apps Email Deletion Settings

For businesses, schools and other organizations, Google also provides 
email as part of its [Google Apps][GoogleAppsInfo] web based services. The email 
service is similar to Gmail, but the email domain name (the part of 
the name after @ symbol) is customized for the business or 
organization rather than "@gmail.com". 

In Email Purger, if an account is added with a Google Apps email address,
Email Purger configures the account with the same [default message 
deletion settings as Gmail][GmailDeletionSettings] email addresses.
