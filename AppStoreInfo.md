## Description

MailShredder will help protect your privacy and the privacy of those who send you email. MailShredder is a specialized utility to readily filter, review, then bulk delete old, unwanted, or confidential messages. MailShredder is for email accounts with IMAP support, such as Gmail or iCloud. 

More and more confidential information is now being sent via email rather than paper documents in regular "snail" mail. For many of the same reasons it was important to shred these confidential documents, it's now equally important to periodically delete the same kinds of information from your email account.

Individual messages may be insignificant, but together they represent an extensive and revealing profile of what you've purchased, who you've done business with, where you've traveled, and other confidential business and personal information. After some time, there's really no reason to keep most messages. In fact, there are important reasons to delete them, such as limiting your exposure if your account is compromised, or to limit the advertising profile some email providers build on you.

MailShredder also helps you stay organized and keep your account storage under quota. After using MailShredder, you'll likely be surprised how many unneeded messages can be safely deleted.

Features: 

• Interactive filtering - select a message needing deletion, then filter for messages from the same sender (assuming those messages can probably be deleted too).
• Save filters for the types of messages needing periodic deletion, such as online purchase receipts or bill payment notifications.
• Support for email accounts with IMAP support, such as Gmail or iCloud. Please confirm your email account supports IMAP before downloading.
• Quick setup for Gmail, iCloud and Yahoo email accounts -  After providing just the email address and password, the IMAP settings and recommended message deletion settings are configured automatically.
• Multiple email account support.
• Control over deletion behavior - either move messages to a trash folder or permanently delete them immediately.
• Passcode to limit who can open the app.

## Review Notes

When the app is first opened, it will prompt for email account information to setup the app for its primary account-based functionility. The app stores the account information locally in the keychain, then uses the information to authenticate with the user's IMAP email server. The following is a test account which can be used for review purposes: 

Account Name: Test
Address: testmc@resultra.com
Password: here2testmc
IMAP Server: imap.gmail.com

After entering the account information, the app will also prompt for an app passcode. This app passcode allows the user to have an extra  layer of security for running the app. Please enter 5555 for testing purposes (any passcode will work, however).
