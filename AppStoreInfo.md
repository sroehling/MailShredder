## Description

MailShredder will help protect your privacy and the privacy of those who send you email. 

MailShredder is a specialized email utility to readily filter, select, then delete old, unwanted, or confidential messages. For example, if you identify a message from a particular sender which can be deleted, MailShredder can easily filter for messages from the same sender. Saved filters can also be created for the types of messages needing periodic deletion, such as online purchase receipts or bill payment notifications.

MailShredder supports email accounts with IMAP support, such as Gmail or iCloud. MailShredder can also be setup with multiple email accounts.

Individual messages may be insignificant, but together they represent an extensive and revealing profile of what you've purchased, who you've done business with, where you've traveled, and other confidential business and personal information. After some time, there's really no reason to keep most messages. However, there are important reasons to delete them, such as limiting your exposure if your account were compromised, or to limit the advertising profile some email providers build on you.

MailShredder also helps you stay organized and keep your account storage under quota. After using MailShredder, you'll likely be surprised how many unneeded messages can be safely deleted.

## Review Notes

When the app is first opened, it will prompt for email account information to setup the app for its primary account-based functionility. The app stores the account information locally in the keychain, then uses the information to authenticate with the user's IMAP email server. The following is a test account which can be used for review purposes: 

Account Name: Test
Address: testmc@resultra.com
Password: here2testmc
IMAP Server: imap.gmail.com

After entering the account information, the app will also prompt for an app passcode. This app passcode allows the user to have an extra  layer of security for running the app. Please enter 5555 for testing purposes (any passcode will work, however).
