## Description

Use Email Purger to help protect your privacy and the privacy of those who send you email. 

Email Purger is a specialized email utility to zero in on and selectively delete old, unwanted, or confidential emails. While regular email apps focus on reading and writing emails, Email Purger is designed exclusively to help you efficiently filter, select, then bulk delete unwanted messages.

Individual messages may be insignificant, but collectively they represent an extensive profile of what you purchased, who you've done business with, where you've traveled, and other confidential business and personal information. 

After some time, there's really no reason to keep most messages. However, there are important reasons to delete them, such as limiting your exposure if your account is compromised, or to limit the advertising profile some email providers build on you.

Email Purger also helps you stay organized and keep your account storage under quota. After using Email Purger, you'll likely be surprised how many unneeded messages can be safely deleted.

Email Purger supports email accounts with IMAP support, such as Gmail or iCloud. Email Purger can also be setup with multiple accounts.
